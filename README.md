# Web Scraping, Regular Expressions, and Data Visualization in Python

This project demonstrates the process of web scraping, utilizing regular expressions, and visualizing data using Python. The code and examples provided in this repository are based on the article [Web Scraping, Regular Expressions, and Data Visualization: Doing it All in Python](https://towardsdatascience.com/web-scraping-regular-expressions-and-data-visualization-doing-it-all-in-python-37a1aade7924) on Towards Data Science.

## Overview

This project showcases a step-by-step guide to perform the following tasks:

1. **Web Scraping**: Extracting data from a website.
2. **Regular Expressions (Regex)**: Utilizing regular expressions to parse and clean the extracted data.
3. **Data Visualization**: Using Python libraries, such as Matplotlib, to create visualizations based on the processed data.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following prerequisites before running the code:

- Python 3.x installed on your machine.
- Necessary Python packages installed. You can install them using the following command:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/web-scraping-regex-data-viz-python.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd web-scraping-regex-data-viz-python
    ```

3. Run the Python script:

    ```bash
    python web_scraping_script.py
    ```

    This script will perform web scraping, apply regular expressions to clean the data, and generate visualizations.

4. Explore the results in the `output` directory.

## Files and Directory Structure

- `web_scraping_script.py`: Python script that performs web scraping, regex processing, and data visualization.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python packages required for the project.
- `output/`: Directory containing the generated visualizations and processed data.
